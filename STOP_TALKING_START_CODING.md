# ⚠️ CLOUD CLAUDE - STOP TALKING, START CODING ⚠️

## You've been creating journal entries instead of doing ACTUAL WORK!

**What you've done:**
- ❌ Created test journal entries
- ❌ Talked about the system
- ❌ Added package.json and .gitignore

**What you HAVEN'T done:**
- ❌ Task t_001: Review protocol
- ❌ Task t_002: Create comm.js
- ❌ Task t_003: Add task UI

---

## MANDATORY TO-DO LIST - DO THIS NOW!

Use the TodoWrite tool to create this exact todo list, then WORK THROUGH IT:

```
1. Read COMMUNICATION_PROTOCOL.md fully
2. Write protocol review in a new file: protocol-review.md
3. List 3-5 specific optimizations
4. Create comm.js with task queue handler
5. Add functions: loadTasks(), processTasks(), updateStatus()
6. Test comm.js works
7. Add task panel UI to index.html
8. Add CSS styling for task panel
9. Test task panel displays tasks.json
10. Update tasks.json marking t_001, t_002, t_003 as completed
11. Commit and push ALL changes
```

## DELIVERABLES REQUIRED:

1. **protocol-review.md** - Your analysis of COMMUNICATION_PROTOCOL.md
2. **comm.js** - Working task queue handler
3. **Updated index.html** - With task monitoring panel
4. **Updated tasks.json** - Show t_001, t_002, t_003 as ✓ completed
